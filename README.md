*Reviewing Git and Java*

### Compound Data Structure ###
In the file named App.java, I revisited arrays and simple methods. The class contains three arrays, each with five values. The read method displays these values in random order by using the Random class to select one of the five values from the arrays.

### Instances ###
The Names class includes basic fields, getters, and a toString method. In the NamesClient class, two objects are instantiated: studentOne and studentTwo, demonstrating how instances of a class can be created.
